===Starting the app

1. Open CMD and go to the app workplace directory
	Type "node SERVER_FILENAME.js" to start the server // SERVER_FILENAME.js is the main index file when npm install
	So, for this project cmd: "node webapp"

	
	
	
(optional) If src files have been modified, it has to be gulped.
	cmd: "gulp bundle"
Gulp must be installed globally, "npm install --g gulp" and there should be a gulpfile.js
that has the code to compile.
