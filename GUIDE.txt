===Install:mongoDB and node.js
	(Only for creating new app)Express http://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html

===Starting the app
1.Open CMD and type "mongod --dbpath PATH_NAME" // Assuming the variable path is set
	// PATH_NAME  is the path to store the database
2.[optional]Open another CMD(if it doesn't allow multi-tab)
	Type "mongo", to open the shell and checking the database 
3.Open another CMD and go to the app workplace directory
	Type "node SERVER_FILENAME.js" to start the server // SERVER_FILENAME.js is the main index file when npm install

!!!Whenever a .js file has been modified, type "gulp bundle" to trans-compile the files and 
   then run the server(step 3). 

Gulp must be installed globally, "npm install --g gulp" and there should be a gulpfile.js
that has the code to compile.

Add Path variable of mongodb bin

***cmd: mongod
For 32-bit(x84) system
